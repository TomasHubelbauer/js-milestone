# Test

For some reason `npx serve .` in the root directory of the repository doesn't
work for me locally in Firefox, instead of fetching both the root directory and
the `test` directory scripts, it fetches just the first one twice.

This works in GitHub Pages, so whatever, not worth bothering about right now.

Instead, run `node test.js` in here to run a Node based test.
